# Steam Bot

I made this bot to learn more about NodeJS, npm and its packages. And I found it very easy to understand and to make something I need quite quickly.

---
## Install

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which contains _npm_ too.

2. Run `npm install` in console.

3. Rename `credentials.example.js` to `credentials.js` and insert there your steam credentials and API key from google.

4. Run `node index.js`.

:warning: NodeJS version _8.0_ or higher is **required** :warning:
